            <h2>Our Purpose</h2>
            <p>The Valor Leander Parent Service Organization (PSO) is a volunteer-led group dedicated to supporting the students, faculty, and staff of Valor Leander. We work in partnership with the school administration and families to enhance the educational experience and foster a strong, vibrant school community, grounded in the principles of classical education.</p>

            <h3>What We Do</h3>
            <p>Our efforts are focused on several key areas:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Supporting Faculty & Staff:</strong> We organize teacher appreciation events, coordinate classroom volunteers, and help fulfill classroom needs (like the wish lists found on this site!) to ensure our educators feel valued and have the resources they need.</li>
                <li><strong>Enhancing Student Life:</strong> The PSO helps organize and fund activities and events that enrich the student experience beyond the core curriculum.</li>
                <li><strong>Building Community:</strong> We strive to create opportunities for parents and families to connect with each other and the school through social events, informational meetings, and volunteer initiatives.</li>
                <li><strong>Fundraising:</strong> We raise funds to support specific school projects, provide resources for classrooms, and contribute to the overall mission of Valor Leander.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Get Involved!</h3>
            <p>Every Valor Leander parent is automatically a member of the PSO! We encourage you to get involved in any way you can, whether it's volunteering your time, participating in events, or contributing to fundraising efforts. Your participation directly benefits our students and strengthens our unique school culture.</p>
            <p>Together, we help Valor Leander fulfill its mission of cultivating wisdom, virtue, and a lifelong love of learning.</p>
