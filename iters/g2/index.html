            <h2>Welcome!</h2>
            <p>Our dedicated teachers strive to cultivate wisdom and virtue in their students through the timeless principles of classical education. They often need specific resources to enrich their classrooms and bring history, literature, logic, and the arts to life.</p>
            <p>This site provides a central place to find and support the classroom needs of our K-12 educators. Browse the wish lists and consider contributing to the formation of the next generation.</p>

            <h2>Why Support Classical Education?</h2>
            <p>Classical education focuses on the Trivium (Grammar, Logic, Rhetoric) and Quadrivium (Arithmetic, Geometry, Music, Astronomy), aiming to develop clear thinking, eloquent communication, and a deep understanding of Western heritage. Your support directly impacts the quality of this formative education.</p>
