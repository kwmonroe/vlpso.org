            <h2>Culture of Contribution</h2>
            <p>Valor's PSO exists to help foster friendship and build community among Valor families through service to our faculty, school, and scholars.</p>
            <p><STRONG>Mission:</STRONG> to support and enrich the school community through purposeful service, meaningful partnership, and active engagement. We strive to uphold the school’s values by fostering a spirit of unity among parents, staff, and students by working together to serve with excellence, humility, and joy.</p>
<p>Rooted in the belief that parents play a vital role in the formation of each child, the PSO exists to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Encourage a strong, supportive parent community aligned with Valor’s mission.</li>
  <li>Assist and uplift faculty through acts of service and appreciation.</li>
  <li>Promote student flourishing by volunteering time, talents, and resources.</li>
  <li>Partner with school leadership to maintain a culture of virtue, learning, and love.</li>
</ul>
<p>Through our shared efforts, we seek to reflect the heart of Valor Leander—building a school culture where families are connected, service is joyful, and every student is surrounded by care and encouragement.</p>
